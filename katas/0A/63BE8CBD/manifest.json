A game is won by the first player to have won at\n   least four points in total and at least two points\n   more than the opponent.\n   \n2. The running score of each game is described in a\n   manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three\n   points are described as \"love\", \"fifteen\", \"thirty\",\n   and \"forty\" respectively.\n   \n3. If at least three points have been scored by each\n   player, and the scores are equal, the score is \"deuce\".\n   \n4. If at least three points have been scored by each\n   side and a player has one more point than his opponent,\n   the score of the game is \"advantage\" for the player\n   in the lead.\n\n[source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#Scoring]","filename.py":"print \"hello\"","output":"============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux2 -- Python 2.7.5 -- py-1.4.20 -- pytest-2.5.2\ncollected 1 items\n\ntest_untitled.py F\n\n=================================== FAILURES ===================================\n_________________________________ test_answer __________________________________\n\n    def test_answer():\n        '''simple example to start you off'''\n        obj = untitled.Untitled()\n>       assert obj.answer() == 6*9\nE       assert 42 == (6 * 9)\nE        +  where 42 = <bound method Untitled.answer of <untitled.Untitled instance at 0x242e950>>()\nE        +    where <bound method Untitled.answer of <untitled.Untitled instance at 0x242e950>> = <untitled.Untitled instance at 0x242e950>.answer\n\ntest_untitled.py:6: AssertionError\n=========================== 1 failed in 0.02 seconds ===========================\n"}}
