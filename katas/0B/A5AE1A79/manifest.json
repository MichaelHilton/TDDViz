Each player\nrolls five six-sided dice. The player places the roll in\na category, such as one-pair, two-pair, small-straight etc\n(see below).\nIf the roll is compatible with the category, the player\ngets a score for the roll according to the rules. If the\nroll is not compatible with the category, the player scores\nzero for the roll.\n\nFor example, if a player rolls 5,6,5,6,2 and scores the\ndice in the two-pairs category they would score 24 (5+6+5+6+2).\n\nYour task is to score a GIVEN roll in a GIVEN category.\nYou do NOT have to program the random dice rolling.\nYou do NOT have to program re-rolls (as in the real game).\nYou do NOT play by letting the computer choose the highest\nscoring category for a given roll.\n  \n\nYahtzee Categories and Scoring Rules\n===================================\n\nYatzy: \n  If all dice have the same number,\n  the player scores 50 points. \n  For example,\n   1,1,1,1,1 placed on \"yatzy\" scores 50\n   1,1,1,2,1 placed on \"yatzy\" scores 0\n\nPair: \n  The player scores the sum of the two highest matching dice.\n  For example, when placed on \"pair\" \n   3,3,3,4,4 scores 8 (4+4)\n   1,1,6,2,6 scores 12 (6+6)\n   3,3,3,4,1 scores 0\n   3,3,3,3,1 scores 0\n\nTwo pairs: \n  If there are two pairs of dice with the same number, the\n  player scores the sum of these dice. \n  For example, when placed on \"two pairs\"\n   1,1,2,3,3 scores 8 (1+1+3+3)\n   1,1,2,3,4 scores 0\n   1,1,2,2,2 scores 0\n\nThree of a kind: \n  If there are three dice with the same number, the player\n  scores the sum of these dice. \n  For example, when placed on \"three of a kind\"  \n    3,3,3,4,5 scores 9 (3+3+3)\n    3,3,4,5,6 scores 0\n    3,3,3,3,1 scores 0\n\nFour of a kind: \n  If there are four dice with the same number, the player\n  scores the sum of these dice. \n  For example, when placed on \"four of a kind\"  \n    2,2,2,2,5 scores 8 (2+2+2+2)\n    2,2,2,5,5 scores 0\n    2,2,2,2,2 scores 0\n\nSmall straight: \n  When placed on \"small straight\", if the dice read \n  1,2,3,4,5, the player scores 15 (the sum of all the dice).\n\nLarge straight: \n  When placed on \"large straight\", if the dice read \n  2,3,4,5,6, the player scores 20 (the sum of all the dice).\n\nFull house: \n  If the dice are two of a kind and three of a kind, the\n  player scores the sum of all the dice. \n  For example, when placed on \"full house\"  \n    1,1,2,2,2 scores 8 (1+1+2+2+2) \n    2,2,3,3,4 scores 0\n    4,4,4,4,4 scores 0\n\n  \n"}}
