Spaces and hyphens may be included in a code,\nbut are not significant. This means that 9780471486480 is\nequivalent to 978-0-471-48648-0 and 978 0 471 48648 0.\n\nThe check digit for ISBN-10 is calculated by multiplying\neach digit by its position (i.e., 1 x 1st digit, 2 x 2nd\ndigit, etc.), summing these products together and taking\nmodulo 11 of the result (with 'X' being used if the result\nis 10).\n\nThe check digit for ISBN-13 is calculated by multiplying\neach digit alternately by 1 or 3 (i.e., 1 x 1st digit,\n3 x 2nd digit, 1 x 3rd digit, 3 x 4th digit, etc.), summing\nthese products together, taking modulo 10 of the result\nand subtracting this value from 10, and then taking the\nmodulo 10 of the result again to produce a single digit.\n"}}
